*Travlr Getaways Application*
In this project, I worked with the **MEAN** stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js) to develop a travel booking website for Travlr Getaways. While I did not build the application from scratch, I was guided through the development and gained insight into how a full stack web application is structured. The frontend was developed as a Single-Page Application (SPA) using Angular, allowing for a seamless user experience with dynamic content updates. The backend was built with Node.js and Express, following an MVC architecture to manage routes, controllers, and models efficiently. MongoDB, a NoSQL database, was integrated using Mongoose to store travel packages, user bookings, and customer data, ensuring scalability and flexibility.

JSON played a crucial role in connecting the frontend and backend by enabling structured data exchange through RESTful APIs. Throughout the project, I encountered opportunities to refactor the code for better efficiency. One significant improvement involved optimizing API calls, reducing the number of network requests by aggregating data responses. Another optimization was implementing reusable UI components in Angular, which improved maintainability and consistency across the application. Additionally, security features such as JWT authentication were integrated to protect user accounts and restrict access to admin-only sections.

API testing was essential to validate functionality, performance, and security. I utilized unit and integration testing to ensure smooth communication between the frontend and backend. Security measures, including role-based access control (RBAC), CORS policies, and API rate limits, were tested to prevent unauthorized access. Despite challenges such as handling authentication tokens during API testing, these tests helped reinforce the security and reliability of the application.

Overall, this project significantly enhanced my full stack development skills, particularly in building and consuming APIs, structuring MVC-based applications, and developing scalable frontends using Angular. It also deepened my understanding of security best practices and testing methodologies. The experience has made me a stronger candidate for roles in web development, equipping me with hands-on experience in modern frameworks and deployment strategies.
